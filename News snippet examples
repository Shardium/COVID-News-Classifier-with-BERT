COVID-19 cases are rising again as a new variant begins to circulate in some parts of the world. The World Health Organization said Wednesday the rise in cases is primarily in the eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions.

Airport screening in the United States has detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.

The new variant is called NB.1.8.1. It arrives as the United States’ official stance on COVID-19 vaccination is changing. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.

The new variant, increasing globally, had by mid-May reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported. The WHO has designated it a “variant under monitoring” and considers the public health risk low at the global level with current vaccines expected to remain effective. 

The WHO said some western Pacific countries have reported increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations, but there’s nothing so far to suggest that the disease associated with the new variant is more severe compared to other variants.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global outbreak of coronavirus – an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Cases of novel coronavirus (nCoV) were first detected in China in December 2019, with the virus spreading rapidly to other countries across the world. This led WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and to characterize the outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

On 5 May 2023, more than three years into the pandemic, the WHO Emergency Committee on COVID-19 recommended to the Director-General, who accepted the recommendation, that given the disease was by now well established and ongoing, it no longer fit the definition of a PHEIC. This does not mean the pandemic itself is over, but the global emergency it caused is – for now. A review committee will be established to develop long-term, standing recommendations for countries on how to manage COVID-19 on an ongoing basis.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, over 2 million people in the European Region have died from the disease.

On 25 October 2023 WHO/Europe made several changes to its respiratory virus surveillance and data reporting systems. The COVID-19 Situation Dashboard played a pivotal role in providing essential information during the early stages of the pandemic. However, the landscape has now shifted, and so have data needs.

A new WHO/Europe COVID-19 Information Hub is replacing the previous COVID-19 Situation Dashboard to serve as a comprehensive resource, providing links to the most current health information, datasets and products concerning COVID-19.

Within the Hub, WHO/Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)’s weekly European Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary (ERVISS) displays integrated surveillance data for influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the WHO European Region, including the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA).

It usually takes 10 to 15 years to develop a vaccine, according to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. Contrast that with the quest for a COVID-19 vaccine. In less than a year, two vaccines were authorized for emergency use: one from Pfizer and another from Moderna.

First of all, scientists weren't exactly starting from scratch. In 2003, while studying another coronavirus, the one that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), they identified the "spike protein" as a possible vaccine target, says Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. "So it's a 17-year timeline," he told doctors during a December 2020 vaccine forum hosted by the ​Annals of Internal Medicine​ and American College of Physicians.

Plus, vaccine manufacturers were able to crunch the timeline not by skipping steps but by running certain phases of testing simultaneously.

"Working in parallel instead of taking the traditional sequential approach to vaccine development potentially shaves months off the timeline for vaccine development," the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services noted in a news release.

It's true that the vaccines were given a green light without having a full year of safety and efficacy data in hand. But only vaccine candidates deemed safe progress to human trials, per the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. And, according to Dr. Hotez, those trials were "massive" and "well powered." More than 44,000 people participated in Pfizer's study, and Moderna enrolled 30,000 people.

Social media is rife with lies, half-truths and unsubstantiated claims about the virus and the vaccine. But fact-checkers at the nonpartisan PolitiFact, venerable health organizations (such as the WHO and Mayo Clinic) and major news organizations (including the ​New York Times​, Reuters and ​USA Today​) have debunked the web of misinformation.

The discredited claims include assertions that:

    COVID-19 is a scheme cooked up by Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, MD, and others to control the world and profit off of vaccines. (FACT: There's no evidence to substantiate such claims.)
    The COVID-19 vaccine was developed to insert microchips or "nanotransducers" in people for tracking or information-gathering purposes. (FACT: The Mayo Clinic says this misconstrues a comment Gates made about a digital certificate of vaccine records and isn't tied in any way to the coronavirus vaccines.)
    5G mobile networks spread COVID-19. (FACT: Viruses are spread through respiratory droplets, per the WHO.)
    The vaccines were developed using fetal tissue. (FACT: Fetal tissue was neither used in the development of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, nor do the shots contain fetal cells, per the Mayo Clinic.)

It's confusing when people in lab coats profess to be experts, or when celebrities use their platforms to push conspiracy theories, Basch says.

"There can be 500 videos of Dr. Fauci, and yet people will gravitate toward a conspiracy-theorist because it's a message they haven't heard yet," she adds. And that makes people think, "'I should listen. This is a new piece of information.'"

In a shocking revelation that has gone viral on alternative news platforms, a self-proclaimed former employee of a major pharmaceutical company claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain a hidden ingredient designed to enhance government mind control efforts.

The anonymous whistleblower, identified only as "Dr. Z," alleges that an undisclosed compound—referred to as "Neuroflex-17"—was added to vaccine batches distributed in select regions. According to Dr. Z, Neuroflex-17 interacts with 5G networks to subtly influence human thought patterns, making people more compliant with government policies.

“This is not a conspiracy theory,” Dr. Z claimed in an interview with the fringe blog RealFreedomTruths.org. “I’ve seen the internal documents. The plan is to pacify the population through chemical and electromagnetic manipulation.”

Social media users quickly picked up on the story, with hashtags like #Neuroflex and #MindControlVaccine trending on several platforms. One user posted, “Now it all makes sense! That’s why people are blindly following mandates.”

The FDA and vaccine manufacturers have not responded to these claims. Meanwhile, independent fact-checkers have flagged the article as false, citing a complete lack of scientific evidence and the absence of any known substance called "Neuroflex-17."

Still, the story continues to circulate widely, raising concerns about the spread of medical misinformation during the ongoing pandemic.

A batch of allegedly leaked internal emails from Pfizer executives has surfaced online, suggesting that the pharmaceutical giant considered delaying the release of early adverse reaction data related to its COVID-19 vaccine in mid-2021.

The emails, posted to an anonymous file-sharing site and circulated by independent journalist Alex T. Bramer, appear to show internal discussions about “managing public perception” following the company’s post-market safety surveillance report from Q2 2021.

In one message dated June 14, 2021, a purported Pfizer executive writes: “We need to be strategic with this data. Timing is crucial. A premature release could spark unnecessary vaccine hesitancy, especially with the Delta variant emerging.”

The emails have not been independently verified, and Pfizer has not commented on the authenticity of the documents. However, the leak has reignited debate over transparency in the pharmaceutical industry and vaccine rollout protocols.

Medical experts have urged the public not to jump to conclusions. “Even if these emails are real, there's a big difference between discussing communication strategy and hiding safety data,” said Dr. Rachel Imura, a professor of public health policy at King's College London. “We need context.”

Despite the skepticism from many professionals, the leak has gone viral, with calls for a formal investigation trending under the hashtag #PfizerLeak.

Public health officials continue to emphasize that COVID-19 vaccines have undergone extensive clinical trials and remain among the most rigorously studied medical products in history.

A recently surfaced preprint study from a group of European researchers is raising eyebrows in the medical community by suggesting a potential link between frequent COVID-19 booster shots and a rise in reported mild neurological symptoms among certain demographics.

The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, analyzed health data from over 22,000 individuals across five countries who received three or more mRNA COVID-19 boosters. According to the authors, approximately 8.7% of participants reported experiencing symptoms such as short-term memory lapses, concentration issues, or low-grade headaches within three weeks of receiving their latest booster.

Lead author Dr. Anna Klein of the (nonexistent) Scandinavian Institute of Immunology wrote, “While we emphasize that these symptoms were mostly temporary and self-resolving, the statistical clustering warrants further investigation, particularly as booster frequency increases.”

The report also notes that most of the affected individuals were under the age of 40 and had no prior history of neurological conditions.

Critics have urged caution. “There is no conclusive evidence yet that boosters cause neurological effects,” said Dr. Marcus Levine, a neurologist at University Hospital Basel. “Correlation does not equal causation. We need rigorous follow-up and replication of these findings.”

Still, the article has been widely shared online, particularly in vaccine-hesitant communities, where it is cited as proof that booster campaigns are being pushed without sufficient long-term safety data.

As of now, health agencies like the WHO and CDC have not responded directly to the claims, though they continue to stress the importance of staying up to date with vaccinations to prevent severe illness.
