COVID-19 cases are rising again as a new variant begins to circulate in some parts of the world. The World Health Organization said Wednesday the rise in cases is primarily in the eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions.

Airport screening in the United States has detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.

The new variant is called NB.1.8.1. It arrives as the United States’ official stance on COVID-19 vaccination is changing. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.

The new variant, increasing globally, had by mid-May reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported. The WHO has designated it a “variant under monitoring” and considers the public health risk low at the global level with current vaccines expected to remain effective. 

The WHO said some western Pacific countries have reported increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations, but there’s nothing so far to suggest that the disease associated with the new variant is more severe compared to other variants.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global outbreak of coronavirus – an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Cases of novel coronavirus (nCoV) were first detected in China in December 2019, with the virus spreading rapidly to other countries across the world. This led WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and to characterize the outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

On 5 May 2023, more than three years into the pandemic, the WHO Emergency Committee on COVID-19 recommended to the Director-General, who accepted the recommendation, that given the disease was by now well established and ongoing, it no longer fit the definition of a PHEIC. This does not mean the pandemic itself is over, but the global emergency it caused is – for now. A review committee will be established to develop long-term, standing recommendations for countries on how to manage COVID-19 on an ongoing basis.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, over 2 million people in the European Region have died from the disease.

On 25 October 2023 WHO/Europe made several changes to its respiratory virus surveillance and data reporting systems. The COVID-19 Situation Dashboard played a pivotal role in providing essential information during the early stages of the pandemic. However, the landscape has now shifted, and so have data needs.

A new WHO/Europe COVID-19 Information Hub is replacing the previous COVID-19 Situation Dashboard to serve as a comprehensive resource, providing links to the most current health information, datasets and products concerning COVID-19.

Within the Hub, WHO/Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)’s weekly European Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary (ERVISS) displays integrated surveillance data for influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the WHO European Region, including the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA).

It usually takes 10 to 15 years to develop a vaccine, according to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. Contrast that with the quest for a COVID-19 vaccine. In less than a year, two vaccines were authorized for emergency use: one from Pfizer and another from Moderna.

First of all, scientists weren't exactly starting from scratch. In 2003, while studying another coronavirus, the one that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), they identified the "spike protein" as a possible vaccine target, says Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. "So it's a 17-year timeline," he told doctors during a December 2020 vaccine forum hosted by the ​Annals of Internal Medicine​ and American College of Physicians.

Plus, vaccine manufacturers were able to crunch the timeline not by skipping steps but by running certain phases of testing simultaneously.

"Working in parallel instead of taking the traditional sequential approach to vaccine development potentially shaves months off the timeline for vaccine development," the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services noted in a news release.

It's true that the vaccines were given a green light without having a full year of safety and efficacy data in hand. But only vaccine candidates deemed safe progress to human trials, per the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. And, according to Dr. Hotez, those trials were "massive" and "well powered." More than 44,000 people participated in Pfizer's study, and Moderna enrolled 30,000 people.

Social media is rife with lies, half-truths and unsubstantiated claims about the virus and the vaccine. But fact-checkers at the nonpartisan PolitiFact, venerable health organizations (such as the WHO and Mayo Clinic) and major news organizations (including the ​New York Times​, Reuters and ​USA Today​) have debunked the web of misinformation.

The discredited claims include assertions that:

    COVID-19 is a scheme cooked up by Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, MD, and others to control the world and profit off of vaccines. (FACT: There's no evidence to substantiate such claims.)
    The COVID-19 vaccine was developed to insert microchips or "nanotransducers" in people for tracking or information-gathering purposes. (FACT: The Mayo Clinic says this misconstrues a comment Gates made about a digital certificate of vaccine records and isn't tied in any way to the coronavirus vaccines.)
    5G mobile networks spread COVID-19. (FACT: Viruses are spread through respiratory droplets, per the WHO.)
    The vaccines were developed using fetal tissue. (FACT: Fetal tissue was neither used in the development of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, nor do the shots contain fetal cells, per the Mayo Clinic.)

It's confusing when people in lab coats profess to be experts, or when celebrities use their platforms to push conspiracy theories, Basch says.

"There can be 500 videos of Dr. Fauci, and yet people will gravitate toward a conspiracy-theorist because it's a message they haven't heard yet," she adds. And that makes people think, "'I should listen. This is a new piece of information.'"
