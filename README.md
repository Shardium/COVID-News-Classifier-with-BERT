# Hallo

This was a little machine learning project I and a few others made on a whim.

It's a single-page web application to classify COVID-19 related news given an input of a news snipper by the user.
Model used was [distilbert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased), which was trained on ~6.4k training dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinagammed/covid19-fake-news-dataset-nlp).
