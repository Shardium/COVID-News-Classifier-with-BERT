This is a little machine learning project that a few of us put together on a whim.

It's a single-page web application that classifies COVID-19-related news based on a news snippet provided by the user.
The model used is [distilbert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased), trained on a dataset of approximately 6.4k samples from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinagammed/covid19-fake-news-dataset-nlp).
